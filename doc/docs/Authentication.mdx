The DAN API uses API keys for authentication. Visit your [API Keys page](https://opendan.ai/account) to retrieve the API key you'll use in your requests.

:::caution

**Remember that your API key is a secret!**
Do not share it with others or expose it in any client-side code (browsers, apps). Production requests must be routed through your own backend server where your API key can be securely loaded from an environment variable or key management service.

:::



All API requests should include your API key in an Authorization HTTP header as follows:
``` bash
Authorization: Bearer DAN_API_KEY
```

**Note:** if you do not want to register, you can use `sk-000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` as api_key to connect anonymously. However anonymous accounts have the lowest priority!

Example curl command:
```bash {4}
curl -L -X POST 'https://api.opendan.ai/api/sd/txt2img' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer sk-000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000' \
